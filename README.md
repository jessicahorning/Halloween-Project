# Halloween-Project
This is a project I created to spice up Halloween.
1. I started by using photoshop to create images of my favorite Halloween characters. Except for the Ghostbuster logo, some wheels aren't meant to be reinvented.
2. I put my photoshop images into Character Aniamator. I wanted them to be able to sing along with Halloween song.
3. I took my finished Character Animator files and placed them into Premiere to combine multiple characters into a grand show.
4. I took a lot of photos of my house (and I mean alot) and placed those photos into Meshroom to recreate my house in digital form. 
5. I took this rendering and placed into blender to make it 3D and to make outlines of the roof slopes.
6. I took my blender image and placed it into After Effects. 
7. I combined spot light effects, text, stock videos, and my own videos to make an hour long show to project onto my house.
